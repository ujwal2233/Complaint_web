            <p>HYDERABAD</p>
            <p>Acting upon several complaints about blockage of roads by building walls, the Hyderabad Disaster Response and Asset Protection Agency (HYDRAA) conducted a drive on Wednesday, pulling down the walls built against rules.</p>
            <p>In the Kapra area, a compound wall enclosing the NRI Colony was removed, throwing the road open to four colonies-- Senior Citizen Colony, Shanti Ville, Lakshmi Villas, Gourinatha Puram, and Vampuguda.</p>
            <p>Another compound wall at Rallaguda village of Shamshabad mandal too was pulled down which was blocking the approach to the Outer Ring Road, besides a 50-metre wall blocking the Army Officers Colony in Sainikpuri.</p>
            <p>Following complaints from residents, a 1,200 square yard government land meant for public utilities in the Defence Colony was secured by HYDRAA, a note informed.</p>
            <p>The local residents complained that the land was divided into plots and sold off. Upon enquiry, it was revealed that the land was divided into five plots, of which a few were sold. The HYDRAA forces removed the encroachments and installed sign boards indicating it as GHMC land.</p>
